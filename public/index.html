								<p>Hello, everyone! 
										My name is Jorge and I was born in 1995 at Venezuela. Started sculpting since I was 4 years old and always love the idea of showing my perception to people. I did my first portrait of a person at the age of 14 and know what I wanted to do after I completed high school. Currently I have just completed my studies at the Art school, Arturo Michelena in Venezuela. I truly enjoyed this experience. I am looking forward to meet more people, and reinforce my knowledge in realism.
								</p>
								<p>My style of art focuses on both traditional and realistic human figure. I very enjoyed showcasing my art identity and world views about my creations. I also enjoyed creating portraits in paint. My first experience with digital art was before attending at the Art school as I didn't know how to sculpt in real life. I started practicing with zbrush in 2013 at the Art school & had a slight knowledge with some digital art software applications. 
									In 2021, I realize about the huge potential & possibilities on digital work and art, started studying and developing my art collections into digital art as an NFT. I have always dreamed to make people feeling happy through my art. 
									Digital space especially NFT, presented such a fantastic opportunity will be a great platform for my purpose. To know my style of Art better, please do click on the link showcasing all my personal work on Opensea:<a href="https://opensea.io/OnemanArtmy?fbclid=IwAR0pxTnH6v0Go9Po2aPrl3UvxNXSZ4Qd44tJGTHeiuXNgeJK_NijXcTqhsY"> https://opensea.io/OnemanArtmy </a>
								</p>
								<P>Thank you all for reading & sincerely hoped you enjoy my art!

								<p>My name is Godson and I was born in 1997 at Nigeria. I have been drawing since the day I can remember for 10 years old. I loved drawing because it is a moment when I could forget everything and create a perfect world in my head. I am still a student at the school Federal university of petroleum resources Effurun.</p>
								<p>My art-style is that of a mixture of anime and me, I think. Because I had this weird ego of not using any reference that's not human. Changing little by little now and my art is getting more realistic. I started using digital in 2015 or so, with my first software used been paint tool sai. Much later, I started to use Medibang which is my favourite tool to use for digital artwork. I have created 2 comics so far. I submitted at the jump tezuka contest in the year 2020.</p>
								<p>One of the main reason I came into NFT space, as an additional source of income for me, won't lie about that. My country is not an art loving country and so I have to do what I can to keep my dream moving, (drawing my own comics and publishing it, having about 10k reads and 1k likes) I am a simple man, I think. The rest about me are clouded in mystery, not even me has uncovered yet, but the parts that really matters have been recorded down here.

								<p>Hello, I'm Cham, a Full-Stack Application Developer & Freelancer from Canada. Since the age of 14, I have an entrepreneur mindset. I illustrated & published my first novel in 2012 and volunteered for charities in my local area. Additionally, I have worked with several computer languages and with the latest technologies. 
									My skills range from illustration to full-stack development to writing content, marketing, data analyst, business communications, and digital designing. I gained valuable experience because of my educational programs, personal blogging & creating NFTs on my spare time. 
									I am constantly searching for actions that will lead me to produce my most productive work. My primary goal is to provide others with a masterpiece that's most likely to make the biggest difference in small communities and other parts of the world. 	
								</p>
								<p>Through art, I want to demonstrate my talent and creativity. It sounds cliché, but creativity fuels my soul and motivates me to work hard! I enjoyed using Procreate, ibis Paint X, and Adobe Creative Suites. And now, I am using Figma and Canva for UI | UX design. Currently, I am excited to be part of a worldwide team that have a strong organizational culture, that improve workflows, and guide decision-making. I strongly believe that contributing to an organized work structure and unifying teamwork, a clear culture can make people work together with a purpose. 
								To learn various skills is my short-term goal. For example, I am learning how to mint NTF & cryptocurrency. Ideally, with the help of today’s technology, I would like to gain a managerial position that would allow me to digitally collaborate in a successful team & contribute significantly to the needs of others.

								<p>The businessman behind "Digital Arts for Social Impact" is passionate about giving hope, dreaming of a better world, greenery, and future technology. Mr. Tan realized how unfortunate some Cambodians have lived, especially those who do not always have the resources and privilege to live a better life. Cambodia is an unpredictable and unstable country with a difficult history, extreme poverty, and a constant struggle with funding for good education. A few charities, however, assist youth with their education, and some organizations recruit international participants. Starting with Cambodia, DASI rounded up artists across the globe and built connections to create a team that will contribute to the transformation of lives of others.</p>
								
								<p>How do we intend to raise funds for this project?</p>
								<p>	Converting 100 hand-drawn arts from underprivileged children into minted NFT Arts on online marketplace and improving the quality of life for everyone across the globe. Our objective is that the community have the right education, a local school, and certified teachers. Effectively advertising to the right demographics will ensure consistent sales.</p> 
								<p>Creating
									20 utility support
									badges with special
									benefits including
									exclusive access to the
									support channel on
									Discord for NFT, drop
									dates, and future events.
								Each supporter will
									receive one signed NFT
									(that is not for sale) and
									will be able to conduct a
									Live Web call with the
									children.</p>

 							    <h3 class="major">Getting Started with Web 3</h3>
								 <p>The Evolution of the web</p>
								<p>Web 1: The Information Economy<p>
								<p>Prior to the year 2000, the internet was considered a “read-only” experience. It was primarily used to dial-up static web pages to consume information.<p>
								<p> Web 2: The Platform Economy<p>
								<p>In Web 2 creators monetize their work via a SaaS model, where they’re paid for a newsletter, artwork, or craft on a regular basis<p>
								<p>Platforms like YouTube can often offer false hope to content creators who want to make money from their work. If you are not paying for a product, you are usually the product.<p>
								<p>Web 3: The Token Economy<p>
								<p>In Web 3.0, creators monetize through the issuance of a social token or NFTs, with non-fungible tokens acting as digital media ownership.<p>
								<p>Smart Contracts are the secret sauce to making this new model work. The creator of the NFT can for example profit from every sale of his artwork and generate recurring revenues. Also, the marketplace owner will be able to set a listing fee.This fee will be taken from the seller and transferred to the contract owner upon completion of any sale, enabling the owner of the marketplace to earn recurring revenue from any sale transacted in the marketplace<p>
								<p>Benefits of Web3<p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>1-A decentralized internet puts control into the hands of creators, users, and communities	<p>
                                 <p>2-Blockchain technology provides important properties that cannot be achieved otherwise.<p>
                                <p> 3-Trust<p>
                                 <p>4-Transparency<p>
                                 <p>5-Efficiency<p>
                                <p> 6-Low Cost<p>
								<p>How does it work?<p>
								<p>Web 3 tries to solve the problem by democratizing revenue streams for creators. It’s still a work in progress. Especially Creators are passionate about this space because it allows greater ownership over their own work and the communities they build. Blockchain technology enables the creation of digital assets which can be used to incentivize sustainable behavior.<p>
								<p>NFT & Social Token<p>
								<p>NFTs allow you to own a piece of digital content with smart embedded functionalities.Think of NFTs as a special type of ownership. If you have ever bought a house or a car, a record of ownership is created by the city and stored in a database. If the database was ever destroyed there would be no record. With a few lines of code, anyone can create a Smart Contract to create an NFT, which becomes a permanent record, impossible to modify or destroy, stored across thousands of machines and databases.Think of NFTs as a special type of ownership.

									<h3 class="Getting Started with Discord 3</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Discord was originally designed for gamers and programmers, but recently gained popularity for its many features and integrations.<p>
									<p>The user interface is reminiscent of Facebook pages or Slack. On the left, there are icons that represent servers. Each Server has different Guilds that represent the high-level structure of the server. Within those guilds, there are more specific channels about different topics - they can either be publicly or privately visible. Certain channels can only be viewed when certain criteria are met.<p>
                                <p> 1-Announcements<p>
								<p>you can stay up to date by clicking the megaphone icon<p>
								<p>2-Text chanel2<p>
								<p>You can send messages with the necessary permission<p>
							    <p>3-Audio chanel<p>
							    <p>You can make calls, video calls, and screen sharing with the necessary permission<p>
							    <p>4-Conferences<p>
								<p>Dedicated to events with many people.<p>
								<p>You can navigate in to our   START-HERE chanel to learn about our discord chanel and be aware of announcements and learn about the project and chat with our community<p>
									<h3 class=.How to Stay Safe in Web3 3</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>1-Do not share them with other community members, or anywhere on Discord or any other tool. If members of the DAO request for them, or links from websites, this should be reported.<p>
									<p>2-Be cautious when connecting to dApps as some of them will try to trick you into handing over your private keys or seed phrases.<p>
									<p>3-BEWARE: MetaMask shares a seed phrase behind the scenes. If one account is compromised, so are all the others in the wallet.<p>
								    <p>4-Scammers on Discord BE EXTRA CAREFUL with DMs (Direct Messages) on Discord and links you may find. 
                                     <p> Discord is known to be flooded with scams and spam bots that send you DMs with dangerous links.<p>
                                     <p> Developer DAO uses Discord Bots for various automated tasks in Discord (like verifying your NFT, issuing POAPS, communicating with the Resource Base, etc.). There are bots who may look like or act like the bots that we use, so proceed with extra caution.<p>
                                     <p> If you are believe you have been DMed with a scam, post it to #report-scams  in Discord.<p>
									 <p>Web3 wallets manage blockchain accounts, which each have their own unique address. Accounts are comprised of a cryptographic key pair, one public, one private. The public key is generated from a private key and the address is derived from the public key.<p>
									 <p> When you create an account in MetaMask, it uses the same private key to generate the public key and addresses of all the accounts created within the wallet. If a malicious actor were to get a hold of your seed phrase or private key, they could use it to sign transactions for any account they'd like. In practice, they could drain all assets in all of your accounts.<p>
									 <p> BEWARE: if you lose you seed phrase, you will not be able to recover your assets<p>
									 <p>Since accounts are comprised of public/private key pairs, if you lose your seed phrase you will not be able to sign transactions for your account, meaning your assets are essentially frozen. In addition, most wallets (i.e. apps allowing you to interact with your account) require your seed phrase for login, so you will not be able to access these either. Make sure you backup your seed phrases and private keys.<p>
									 <p>1.Hardware wallets are safest<p>
									 <p>Since private keys are used for signing transactions from your account, keeping them safe is of the utmost importance. The best way to do this is by using a hardware wallet (aka "cold storage"). Hardware wallets like Ledger and SafePal store your private key completely offline on a device with no WiFi, Bluetooth or NFC connection. Using mobile/desktop wallets, you can authenticate (ex: scanning QR codes) and interact with the wallet while still keeping the private key off the device.<p>
									 <p>Mobile and desktop wallets offer more ease of use, however, they store their private keys on the given device, meaning a bad actor could gain access to your private key via an internet exploit whereas hardware wallets are not susceptible to this.<p>
									 <p>2.TIP: When minting NFTs, use an isolated "burner" wallet to make the purchase.<p>
									 <p> When participating in a public mint on an NFT project's website, you usually connect, click the "Mint" button and sign a transaction to purchase your token. However, when you do this, you don't know necessarily know what you're signing off on. Because of this, it's a good idea to use an isolated "burner" wallet for these types of on-chain activities. Doing so isolates your main holdings and protects them from malicious behavior. Put enough money to pay for the NFT and cover gas costs, but nothing more.<p>
									 <p> Because the blockchain is a public ledger, you could technically audit every smart contract you interact with and audit it for malicious code. This, however, would require you to be able to (or even want to) be able to read code. Burner wallets allow you to interact with smart contracts freely while minimizing your risk/exposure.<p>
